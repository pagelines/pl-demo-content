# PageLines Demo Content
===============

In this public repository you will find the demo content (.xml file) and configuration file (pl-config.json file) for all PageLines created DMS-based themes.

### How To Install

To install the demo content and activate the demo's settings you must do the following.

1. Install the WordPress Importer
2. Go to Tools > Import > From WordPress
3. Upload the *.xml file for the theme you've installed.  This will load in all the pages that are present in the demo.
4. Go to the DMS Import/Export panel in Site Settings on your site's home page.
5. Click the big green button that says "Select Config File (.JSON)".

At this point, DMS will load all the front end customizations and styles.  If you want the home page and the blog page to be the same, you will need to go to the WordPress dashboard and under Settings > Reading set the front page to home and the posts page to blog.
